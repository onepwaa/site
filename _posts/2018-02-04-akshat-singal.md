### HoWSC 2 | Akshat Singal

My journey at WSC began as a fluke when I was asked to join a newly formed team
just 2 days before my regional round and my knowledge of the program and the
world I was so recklessly about to throw myself into can be summed up in the
fact that at that point in time I didn't even know the format of the
competition, or the fact that the round I was going for was just one of many.
All of this changed the moment I entered the auditorium and saw Burch and Izzie
on stage surrounded by a bunch of weird looking soft toys. As someone who
regularly competed in competitions I could still feel the electrifying
atmosphere and the buzz of adrenaline which I had become all to familiar with
still sent a shiver down my spine.

I knew I was home when I heard a group of people talking so passionately about
Greek mythology, I knew I was home when I wasn‚Äôt laughed at for (quite daringly
if I may add) shouted out ‚ÄúStar Wars is better!‚Äù when Daniel came in wearing a
Star Trek uniform. I knew I was home when everywhere I looked, I saw people
equally, if not more, excited about exploring new ideas and questions in the
Bowl or taking stances that would make any seasoned debater shiver during the
debates.

When the round finished I left the host school with a few medals, a few
friendships and a lot of stories heavier. As I look back at it now I can‚Äôt
believe my foolishness in thinking WSC was behind me because it took only the
car ride back home for me to realize that I needed to go to globals and perhaps
beyond. WSC had become a part of my life. The Hamilton soundtrack was now my
most played, English articles for school were now being written on the cinematic
storytelling of ‚ÄòPushing Daisies‚Äô and there was rarely a conversation where I
didn‚Äôt use a phrase or two from Back To the Future or The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy.

Yet after all, this it was only on my way back from the final meal before the
closing ceremony at Athens that I realized WSC was more than just the awards you
won or the points you scored. WSC was the people you met, it was the stories you
made and the stories that made you. WSC was-is-will always be more than just an
academic competition.¬†**It‚Äôs a platform for people from all walks of life to get
together, to forget all social protocols and be unapologetically weird
together.**

I was always told since the time I started talking to others, I was too weird
for any sane human to want to talk to me but the people I met at WSC made me
realize that being normal was overrated anyways. Like Tetris taught us: ‚ÄúIf you
try to fit in, you‚Äôll end up disappearing.‚Äù¬
**I will be forever thankful to this competition not for the accolades it has
given me but rather for the endless memories and countless friends.**

Thank you, for the wand I broke because I was too busy talking to someone, for
the games of Cards Against Humanities with friends from BJ&H, for the mountain
of vegetables that still make me cringe, for the games of Jungle Speed and chess
at ToC, and finally for letting me know it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a short
awkward alpaca with far too many problems to list.¬†**What matters is that you‚Äôre
a short awkward alpaca with far too many problems to list with confidence.**

Dedicated to Daddy's Diner, B&JH (both new and old), everyone I played chess
with at Yale and everyone else I met along the way.
