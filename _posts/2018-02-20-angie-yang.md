### HoWSC 3 | Angie Yang

I was told joining WSC would “boost” my college applications. Now who wouldn't
want that? I joined WSC thinking it was just some type of extracurricular
activity. But believe me, the moment I stood in the convention center with all
these other scholars, I was overwhelmed by how happy and excited these people
were and of course—how wrong I was. After seeing Daniel and Burch drop to the
stage in space suits, eating cafeteria food in-between debates, receiving my
first alpaca, and raving the night out, **I realized that didn’t stay up late at
night researching about Elvis Presley or give a speech in a meeting room
trembling with anxiety because I wanted something nice on my resume. I did all
that because I wholeheartedly wanted to.**

At one point of the competition, everything went silent as I looked at the
people surrounding me. I saw people from Kenya, Macedonia, Brazil, and many
other countries. I saw scholars with an abundance of medals around their necks —
it was intimidating. But there was one thing that comforted and relieved me
— **we may not be from the same race, we may not have the same beliefs, and we
may not like the same things, but one thing I can guarantee we all have in
common is the reason why we were all here, standing in the same room.**

I was dragged into the community when one of my friends from my former school
texted me at 3:00 A.M. to pay \$800 and buy a plane ticket to Hanoi. I thought
it was impossible. It was about a week or two before the actual global round —
I’ve never competed, not even at a regional round, I was completely unfamiliar
with the curriculum, I just didn’t know what to expect — but there I was,
holding my ticket and passport in hand: ready for whatever was about to come at
me.

I used to think friends become harder to make as I grow older, especially in
WSC, where people are all different— another one of the many things I was wrong
about. **I learned that we can all bond over our differences and simultaneously,
we also bond over the similarities we never knew we had.** I would really like
to thank all the friends and acquaintances I’ve made during the rounds and even
after them: as much as I would love to list all their names (would be a long
list, haha), you guys already know who you are 😉. And most importantly, thank
you to my globals teammates who went through the whole experience with me and
one of my friends who turned out to be my teammate for ToC, who went through the
entire emotional rollercoaster with me; I couldn't have done it without you.

The fact that thousands of scholars of different backgrounds and cultures meet
up at one place in the world with the same dreams and aspirations really makes
me feel all warm and mushy inside. Sometimes we all come to these rounds aiming
for prizes so much that we forget about enjoying the experience. But the rounds
reward us with more than just medals and trophies— they reward us with priceless
memories and great homies we’ll never forget. In the end, we all come back with
our alpacas in our arms, with smiles on our faces, trying really hard to conceal
our excitement for the next round.
